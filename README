Boardspirator is a Boardpuzzle Framework and is jQuery subplugin tp$.gio.
In other words, it is wrapped into a jQuery plugin, tp.
The files are spread via directory tree, but can be assembled in one file.

These features and philosophy of tp are also true for Boardspirator.
   ... except images, which are used only in game boards,
   ... except css-ids in ads in some index files


Plugin folder tree structure.
	Folder/file names follow project semantics.
	
How to run: 
  URL startup parameters example:
	index.htm?game_key=colortrain&debug=true which will run game colortrain
  Entry points:
	this link which calls entry.js ...

There is no server stuff:
    When running from local hard-drive, Chrome restricts JavaScript, FF or
	IE let games flow.

Functionality:
	New Games can be coded and attached from games/ folder
	Collections of maps can be shared between games and are in collections/ folder.
	Text maps can be copy-pasted while Boardspirator is loaded.
	Edit map feature is not elaborated.


Diary:
	is a collection of step by step versions.
	They are snapshots of folder "play".
	It is good to have backup versions when current version is
	overengineered and one can fork from earlier ...

	For example, version 49 does not use css and images for dynamic "beautified" select box
	control. Can be a base for future browsers, with good CSS3 support.

	Diary also good if documentation lacks something. For example,
	in version 34, /var/www/bgame/gio/diary/34/games/sokoban/config.js
	has clear layout for tiles_map. This is a basic internal format for map
	which is used at least till verions 53, but it is not documented and 
	not shown in files in version 53.

Game Tree:
	games--collections--maps
	It is reflected on front page gui as three "select box" controls.
	The leaf of this tree is a map, game map, or often gm.
	Each map has own html-board comprised with tiles.
	When user toggles from map to map, then game-collection-map-round is preserved.

 
... Draft begins ...
Game definition matrix.
It is local. Describes interaction at given point of position.

  first-level interaction
	1. blocking policy:	block/pass
	2. blocking role:	blocks/passes
	3. interaction_matrix:	blocks,pushed (,swapped )
  second-level-post-interaction:
		mimics (, sticks, repells, ... )

Unit checked on interaction goes out of scope of further checks
... Draft ends ...


Internal data representation (map) format:

	Before game is initialized, it takes map eigther from internal defaul text, or
	reads file from parent site.
	For example, for sokoban family maps, map is read and compiled into
	tiles_maps for each game_map.colonies[colony_ix].tiles_map

	Later, in file init.js, tile_map is converted to positions.
	(methods: gio.init_start_position, gio.compile_colony)
	Format of positions commented in gio.compile_colony.
    
	start_position does not have dom-elements. It is save to do a deep
	copy of start_position, which is done, for example, in creating
	a new round: r.pos=tp.core.tpaste([],gm.start_pos);



Licensing:
	If license for map is unknown, the framework provides link to external site map,
	and opportunity for user to copy-paste the map into the game.


TODO:

 Drawbacks:
  add or modify images feature is not yet added. Some work required to imagefy scroll bars and drop down-button.
  works for FF and Webkit,  round corners not always work in IE 9	
  no scroll event handler, cannot use mouse wheel
  not all elements exist
    scroll slider is missed
    buttons are not visibly pushed, when clicked, only hover effect works 	
  Opera not always works when control is used in the game: http://landkey.net/gio/gio/bs/index.htm
  Needs better documentation beyond supplied examples.

 Advantages:
  no images used - simple
  no css files, all settings are dynamic



You are welcome.
