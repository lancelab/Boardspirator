	<h1>Public Zone</h1>

	Explore interface to experiment and become comfortable.
	You even don't need a server when working in Public Zones. Download a software and
	run your personal zone locally off-line. Go to DevZone for more details.


	P l a y s e s s i o n s
	Your play session or can be copy-pasted to your text editor and pasted back when landing to the site again.
	Only one map rounds can be copy-pasted at once. Do more maps step by step.

	C r a f t s e s s i o n s
	Game maps and playpaths you created can be copy-pasted the same ways as a playsession.
	


<h1>Map formats</h1>
	


Collection-text is comprized with maps and header.
Maps and headers called "pzones" in map parser.
Default pzone format is a Sokoban format.


Collection-text includes directives, which are part of more complex format, Colorban format.
For example:

:::map                  triggers colorban pzone and beginning of the map
:::playpath             expects colorban playpath lines to follow ...
:::playpath=sokoban     allows "short" sokoban playpath to follow ...

Colorban board zone lines can begin after :::map directive and must end with :::board_end like this

:::map
-$-@-
:::board_end
:::map_end

":::game_context=..." directive cannot happen after :::board_end


Crafter, should look at examples to see how directives are used.



N o n  -  l o g g e d i n    z o n e

When crafting own maps, pay attention when mixing different games in one album. Explicit
:::game_context directive should solve inconsistencies.



D r e s s

Confusing. Needs following clarification.

Full definition in album:

dresses: { default : { skin_key : 'dskin' }, ... special : { skin_key : 'nu_i_nu', ... } }
If nothing is set about dress in map, images taken from def/skins/dskin and def/skins/nu_i_nu.

However, dress inherits from dress:

  default &lt;-- base_game.dresses.default and 
  special &lt;-- album.plgam.dresses.special &lt;-- base_game.dresses.default
  Tile size, backgroundColor, ... belong to dress and overriddend by child dress.

  If :::dress=my_dress and :::common_skin=other are specified in a map-script, then:
  my_dress inherits from dress "my_dress" of the same album,
  images are taken from def/skins/other


Examples:

:::dress=flocks
:::skip


:::dress=night
:::title=Night
:::inherit_from=flocks
:::skin=flocks
:::chosen
:::image=f=blue_man2.png
:::back_image=transparent.png
:::common_skin=very_special
:::center_image=transparent.png
