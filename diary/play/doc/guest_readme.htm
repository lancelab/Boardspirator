	This site allows to play, autosolve, and craft board puzzles derived from game <a href="whirly.htm">Whirly</a>.
	All puzzles are loaded from text files called gamions.
	Gamions can be pasted into this site or can be loaded from Internet links.
	This site uses #@title@# as a back end player.

	<h2 id="components">Gamions</h2>

	In simple case, gamion is a Sokoban maps' collection.
	In general, gamion contains definitions of games, albums, and maps' collection.

	Game is a set of rules to play. "Game" here means a puzzle-game. In context of #@title@#,
	Game is a mathematical definition. It contains breeds, rules, and ovbjective.
	It cannot be copyrighted, but credited.

	Album merges together all components of playgame.
	Album merges four things: game, dress, collection-references, and listing.

		Dress is how game looks and is interpreted in words.
		Dress includes images which are called "Skin".
		Listing specifies how to group albums in front-page-listing.
		Collection is a file containing maps.

	After merging, album displays itself as a listing on front-page. Game name often attached to album name.

	Traditionally dresses and maps can be copyrighted.

	Games can be derived from core-games or from external-games which are already derived from core-games.

	"Collection-references" can be references to gamions ( ... so "album-gamion" is a recursive structure ).
	This makes possible redressing and changing game-context for existing games and gamions.
	For example, one can land to Sokoban maps in Flocks context and apply Flock-rules to Sokoban maps.

	U R L - q u e r y    P a r a m e t e r s   control execution of the player. For example:

			...&aurl=http://mysite.com/mypath/myalbum.txt               - albums url, maps in target file are ignored
			...&curl=http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/m1   - collection url, target intends to have maps
			...&curl=//mycollection_path/mycollection.txt
			...&akey=sokoban                                            - album key
			...&ckey=yes_this_is_my_collection_key                      - gamion key
			...&mkey=yes_this_is_my_map_key
			...&dkey=yes_this_is_my_dress_key
			...&mix=345                                                 - map index
			...&cix=123                                                 - gamion index. collection index. 
			...&asingle                                                 - suppresses display of other's albums except of &aurl
			...&slim=300000                                             - positions' number limit for solver


		&aurl or &curl can be set independently: both or one of them. 
		Game Crafters may want use these parameters to point to own sites.




	<a id="solver"> </a>
	<h2>Solver ..</h2>

	.. is breadth-first and weak. Its power depends on size of your computer memory.
	Solver memory limit is preset to slim=(300000 positions) for PC with 1 Gig memory.
	If your computer has less, solver may freeze your browser. If you computer has more,
	on your own risk, you may increase the limit to solve harder puzzles.

	For FireFox 11, Ubuntu, empirical values are:
		slim=300000 for 1 Gig,
		slim=4000000 for 3 Gig. (Ubuntu 10.04, FF 11, Boarspirator version: 1.200.)

	Examples of supplying slim in URL string:
		Do land to player URL, select game of your choice, and then run solver like this:
			#@AppRoot@#/?slim=1000000
		or
			#@AppRoot@#/?akey=sokoban&slim=100000&map_ix=1

	How to:

		Each map has own solver. They can run concurrently. (Not a good idea for performance.)
		You can start solver and go playing on another map.
		If you start solver and start playing the on the same map, 
		     your game will be overriden when solver finds solution. 
		     Overriding goes only to current round, other rounds of the same maps are intact.

		Solver starts from given position, not from initial position of the map.
		Initially, solver has two options "Search All" and "Search First".

	Usage:

		1. To generate new game-scenario, run solver for co-game, find "longest" solution in terms of
		   interactions or moves, then co-vert the scenario.

		2. Solving in "reverse mode". 
		   It is indicated that some Sokoban and Colorban games are solved faster when solving in reverse mode which
		   practically is:
		       Description:    Land to map, Convert map to co-map, guess in which closed area hero(s) must be and add them into
			                   map manually, confirm map, start solver.
		       Actions:        "Edit Co-Position", add heros manually, Ctr+d, Search/First.


	There are possible difficulties at the edge of Web-browser capabilities:
		Browsers die, quit, crash differently on different OSes.
		For example: Around version 1.163. In Windows 7, in FF 16, solver halts on 2046 Megs of mem.  32 bit limit?
		So, far the best combination we found is FF 11, on Ubuntu 10.04 on 
		Acer laptop Aspire 5532.

	<h2 id="kids">Puzzles for Kids</h2>

		Many of us have kids and want to develop their analytical skills ...
		Don't compain for the lack of kid-adapted puzzles, you don't
		need programming skills to craft them ... 
		Here are the examples ... games: <a href="../?akey=kids6&asingle&curl=//def/albums/kids/6.json.txt">Kids 6</a>, <a href="../?akey=kids6co_colo&asingle&curl=//def/albums/kids/6co_colorban.json.txt">Kids 6 CoColo</a>, <a href="../?akey=kids7&asingle&curl=//def/albums/kids/7.json.txt">Kids 7</a>... their scripts:
		<a href="../def/albums/kids/6.json.txt">Kids 6 Dress</a>, <a href="../def/albums/kids/collections/default/maps.txt">Kids 6 Maps</a>,
		<a href="../def/albums/kids/6co_colorban.json.txt">Kids 6 CoColo Dress</a>,  <a href="../def/albums/kids/collections/default/coco_maps.txt">Kids 6 CoColo Maps</a>
		<a href="../def/albums/kids/7.json.txt">Kids 7 Dress</a>.

		Yes, there are other challenges compare to mature age puzzles:
		the heros must have character and gameplay must be motivating and rewarding ...
		Craft your images, make maps you feel be entartaining for your child ...		 
		If you afraid to play on-line, once you dowloaded the player, disconnect
		from adult-Internet and continue playing ...
